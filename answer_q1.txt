First we describe the corruption_function, we can use something simaler to pyramids.
when building a gaussian pyramid in each level we loose resolution, we also
lose some pixels but we can solve that with zero padding and blurring.
So for the corruption_function we will blur, switch every second/third/fourth pixel
with a zero, and blur again in this way we will get the same image but with a bad
resolution.
