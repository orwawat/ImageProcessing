From the convolution theorem both images suppose to be the same.

But as we remember the Fourier is infinite, so when doing convolution on the edge we use "the other side" of the image (just the next image)
When we are doing convolution in the regular space, there nothing after the last row/column, so we need to decide how to do it (the signal.convolve2d get it as a parameter), if we choose 'wrap' we will get exactly the same image as in the Fourier space, if we use a different method we will get different values.
But still, the difference will be only in the first/last KERNEL_SIZE rows/columns (where kernel size is the size of the kernel we are using to do the blur)
