When not centering the kernel the image "splits" into 4 partial images that are placed together.
I am not sure what is the reason we get exactly this structure of images, but the difference is because the phase in the fourior space.

When calculating the magnitude we will get exactly the same in both cases but the phase will differ, and when going back to the image space we use the phase.
