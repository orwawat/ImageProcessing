First let's understand what the laplacien pyramid contains: when building the laplacien 
pyramid in each level the frequencies that we will see 
will be smaller and smaller (we get rid of the details and stay 
only with the "raw" image).

Now, the cofee vector multiplies the levels in a constant --> we will get more/less 
(if the cofee is greater then 1/smaller than 1) of the matching level.

Let's assume we multiply a low level (big image) by a constant that is greater than 
one --> we have hiegh frequncies there that we amthize them 
(because we add that level agian at leat partialy to the image) --> we get sharper image.

We need to also remmber that multiplying by a constant will change the intensity of 
the image, so we can get brighter/darker parts of the image.
