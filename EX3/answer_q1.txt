The cofee vector controls the intensity of the image.
when building the laplacien pyramid in each level the frequencies that we will see 
will be smaller and smaller (we get rid of the details and stay 
only with the "raw" image).

For example, if we multiply a low level by a number > 1 we will make the "raw" image (the low frequencies ) brighter
